# <Password_Generator>

## Description

Randomized password generator with character choices!
I created this generator with the goal of making a usable password generator for myself for the future with the ability to pick between characters and gain a deeper understanding of javascript.
It solves the problem of always using the same password everywhere since that is a security liability and unnecesary risk these days.
I learned how to generate random content with the math floor and math random functions and how to propperly apply fuctions in a complex matter.
